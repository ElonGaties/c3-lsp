# C3 LSP
![build result](https://github.com/pherrymason/c3-lsp/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)  

WIP LSP for [C3 language](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c)  
Using tree-sitter grammar rules from https://github.com/zweimach/tree-sitter-c3

## Server
Features:
- Na√Øve auto completion items from same document.
- Go to declaration (variables and functions, only on same file).



## YACC to TreeSitter 
Experiment based on https://github.com/miks1965/yacc-to-tree-sitter to convert C3 yacc grammar file to treesitter grammar.js

It is not complete, as it ignores lexical rules.
