# C3 LSP
[![Go](https://github.com/pherrymason/c3-lsp/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pherrymason/c3-lsp/actions/workflows/go.yml)

WIP LSP for [C3 language](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c)  
Using tree-sitter grammar rules from https://github.com/zweimach/tree-sitter-c3

## Server
**Features**
- [x] Indexes workspace variables and function definitions
- [x] Na√Øve auto completion items of variables and function names defined in the workspace.
- [x] Go to declaration.

- [ ] Index struct members and methods
- [ ] Include type information to indexed variables.
- [ ] Hover information
- [ ] Offer information about stdlib?
- [ ] Go to definition
- [ ] Go to type definition
- [ ] Go to implementation

## YACC to TreeSitter 
**Experiment** based on https://github.com/miks1965/yacc-to-tree-sitter to convert C3 yacc grammar file to treesitter grammar.js

It is not complete, as it ignores lexical rules.
